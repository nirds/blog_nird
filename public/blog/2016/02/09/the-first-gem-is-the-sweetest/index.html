	<div class="entry-content"><p>As my colleagues have mentioned in previous posts, we NIRDs have begun an initiative to contribute more to the open source community. As a junior developer who had never contributed to the open source community, this put me on unfamiliar ground. For many, that first step into the unknown is daunting &ndash; for me it was terrifying. I mean, I’m mostly self-taught, and as a result, I have a paralyzing fear of everyone discovering that I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">complete fraud</a>. ::Deep breath:: Until now, irrational self-preservation against an imaginary threat has won out over the desire to give back to the community that helped me get to where I am today; but that’s all changed (j/k I’m still scared, but I’m trying to be braver about <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/05/23/the-extraordinary-depressing-power-of-failing-upwards/">failing upwards</a>).</p>

<p>Thankfully, I wasn’t on my own &ndash; I was a part of a team! After dipping our toes into the open source pool by making a small contribution to someone else’s project, we decided that we wanted to learn something new &ndash; we wanted to build a gem. Since we were new to the process, we wanted to start with something small; conveniently, we had recently written a small amount of Javascript to integrate the handy <a href="https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate">will_paginate gem</a> into an AngularJS app, so this seemed like as good a point as any from which to proceed.</p>

<p>Since we had never built a gem, we began by researching the process. <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/books/build-a-ruby-gem/">Build a Ruby Gem by Brandon Hilkert</a> was thorough coverage of the subject &ndash; but actually way more than we needed! See, we wanted to build a gem that fed some Javascript and CSS into the asset pipeline of the apps that would use it &ndash; in the larger scheme of things, that’s not too heavy duty. Luckily, there are several <a href="https://gorails.com/episodes/creating-gems-for-frontend-javascript-libraries">quick</a> and <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/create-ruby-gem-jquery-plugin-basics/">dirty</a> <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/how-to-build-a-rails-engine/">guides</a> out there on to how to do this!</p>

<p>Since we had already built the feature into a project, it was really straightforward to pull it out into a gem. First, we abstracted the existing code as much as we could and took out any specific references to the app that it lived in. Generic code is reusable code, and what is a gem if not reusable code? Once we had done that, we just followed the guides linked to above on how to turn the code into a gem. Let me lift the main points from <a href="http://carlosbecker.com/posts/gemify-your-assets/">Carlos Becker’s excellent post</a> to demonstrate how straightforward the process is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create the project skeleton
All this takes is one command in the terminal!</p></li>
<li><p>Create the vendor/assets folder
In the case of our gem, we actually created the app/assets folder. Why? Because, if you’re including someone else’s javascript in a project, for example, convention dictates that you put it in the vendor/assets folder. It’s not like anything is going to explode if you put javascript you wrote in vendor/assets, but the contents of vendor/assets are understood to be something akin to gems &ndash; code by other people that you include in your project. Since we wrote this code, it’s going in our assets folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the assets to the folders
All we did was move the files from the app we pulled our code from to PRETTY MUCH THE SAME EXACT PLACE (app/assets) in the gem we just made. Magical!</p></li>
<li><p>Test
Well&hellip;it can’t all be easy. This step is conquerable, but was definitely the hardest part of this project &ndash; so we’ll cover it in another post.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Once all that was done, we tried out our new gem in our original project by adding it to that project’s gemfile and then bundling. Viola! ng_will_paginate delivered up some nicely paginated angular objects via rails and the will_paginate gem!</p>

<p>There are two morals to this story:</p>

<p>The Ruby on Rails community is a wonderland of handy stuff created by people who are enthusiastic about making useful stuff. This isn’t limited to incredibly niche gems &ndash; it includes blog posts about how to make incredibly niche gems!
The bar is easier to surmount than our fears may be telling us &ndash; we too, can produce something that is helpful to the community.</p>

<p>I can’t count the number of times stumbling across a casual mention of some small bit of Rails wisdom has helped me in my path to becoming a better developer. If you’ve solved a problem, I can almost guarantee that someone out there will benefit from it if you make it available.</p>
