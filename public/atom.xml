    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of us NIRDs built a gem recently, <a href="https://github.com/nirds/ng_will_paginate">ng_will_paginate</a>, to allow easy use of the fabulous will-paginate gem with an Angular-fronted Rails application. This was the first time we built a gem that uses assets, and it was an excellent learning opportunity. As mentioned in <a href="http://blog.nird.us/blog/2016/02/09/the-first-gem-is-the-sweetest/">Patrick’s post</a>, we traveled a winding path while building this gem. Namely, we extracted the code for it from another project, which meant that we were pulling in fully formed code, and not practicing TDD (please don’t judge us). As a result, we built the gem without the proper testing options and we needed to add them retroactively. This was a complicated thing to research and figure out, but implementation ended up not being too difficult.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I’ll walk you through what you need to do to implement this yourself:</p>

<p>Since our gem pulls in assets for the client app, it’s considered an engine (you can see this mentioned in many of the guides linked to in Patrick’s post). To test it properly, we&rsquo;ll write code in the dummy app that uses our gem’s functionality, then write javascript specs in the dummy app to test that this functionality is working. In contrast, if we were just writing Ruby code, we’d be able to test with Rspec within the gem’s spec/ directory.</p>

<p>First, we’ll get the dummy app by generating a new plugin project with the same name as our gem, with options to include a dummy app. Then, we can move it into our real project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Navigate outside the gem directory</li>
<li>Generate a plugin with the same name as your gem (gem-name in example), with following options: <code>$rails plugin new gem-name --mountable --dummy-path=spec/dummy --skip-test-unit</code></li>
<li>Move the generated spec/dummy/ directory to your gem&rsquo;s spec/ directory: <code>$ mv gem-name/spec/dummy/   path-to/your-actual/gem_name/spec/</code></li>
<li>Delete that generated plugin &ndash; it&rsquo;s worthless now</li>
<li>Navigate back to your gem&rsquo;s directory</li>
<li>Add the database that the dummy app is configured to use, as a development dependency in your gem&rsquo;s gemspec file (the default is sqlite3)</li>
<li>Run <code>$ bundle install</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Next, we’ll write some tests and run them.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the dummy app, write code that incorporates your gem’s functionality in the way you expect client apps to use it. For us, this meant building a tiny Angular app that had our gem’s service as a dependency, and a single controller that used the service’s methods. This required adding rails, coffee-rails, and angularjs-rails gems to our gemspec file. Because we planned to use <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> to test, we also added jasmine-rails to the gemspec at this step. Run <code>$ bundle install</code> again after all gemspec changes.</li>
<li>Next, in the dummy app, write your tests. We used jasmine, and the spec for our service was located at <code>spec/dummy/spec/javascripts/paginationServiceSpec.js.coffee</code>.</li>
<li>We run our tests the simplest way: by starting a Rails server and visiting <a href="http://localhost:3000/specs.">http://localhost:3000/specs.</a> Note that this Rails server must be started from within the dummy app, not the gem’s root directory.</li>
<li>Now, you can iterate on writing code that more accurately uses the gem’s functionality, changing the gem’s code, and writing better tests, in whatever order you like. Just refresh <a href="http://localhost:300/specs">http://localhost:300/specs</a> to re-run the test suite.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When working on a complex application, you may need more than one application or service running at one time. This can be a pain to manage without great tools like the <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">Foreman</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pitluga/subcontractor">Subcontractor</a> gems, because you would have to have all of those apps and services open in different tab in order for your one complex app to function properly.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Let’s use a simple example. Say we’re developing on a customer_app that requires three other apps: crude_app, silly_app, encouraging_app, and each of these applications sends and receives data from the customer_app.</p>

<p>In this kind of situation, you might open up multiple tabs and start all of your applications or services &ndash; except one &ndash; and then spend up to 30 minutes asking “Why isn’t this working?” More often, though, you might start up all the right things, but be irritated by how tedious that is. Even if it’s only three applications, that time adds up.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a solution. The Foreman and Subcontractor gems help manage this for you. Foreman allows you to manage multiple processes with a Procfile containing a list of all of the applications and/or services you’d like to start up at the same time. Subcontractor allows you to start that process from different directories and under the gem configuration specified by <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv">RBENV</a>. There are many ways to <a href="https://github.com/pitluga/subcontractor">configure your Procfile</a> so you can set-up your application just the way you want it; for this post I’ll focus on basic setup,  a couple of small problems, and what I did to get around them.</p>

<p>Here is what you have to do to get started:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Foreman and Subcontractor</li>
<li>Write a Procfile that describes what services you apps you want to run</li>
<li>Type “foreman start&#8221; in terminal</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Installing Foreman and Subcontractor:</strong></p>

<p>Foreman and Subcontractor are meant to be run outside the context ruby-gemset, if you use RVM, or any other version manager of your application. Let’s return to our example client_app, with the folder structure below. You want to make sure you’re installing the gems in the client folder not in the subfolders that contain application code.</p>

<p><strong>Writing a Procfile:</strong></p>

<p>Each entry in a Procfile (one entry per application or service) follows the basic format:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">App_name</span><span class="ss">:subcontract</span> <span class="n">package</span> <span class="n">manager</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">gemset</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">directory</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">termination</span> <span class="n">signal</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">command</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">port</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Our example client_app would have a Procfile that includes info for crude_app, funny_app, and customer_app:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="ss">crude</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">subcontract</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">rvm</span> <span class="n">ruby</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="vi">@crude_app</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">chdir</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">/crude_app</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">signal</span> <span class="no">INT</span> <span class="o">--</span> <span class="n">rails</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="mi">3001</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="ss">funny</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">subcontract</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">rvm</span> <span class="n">ruby</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="vi">@funny_app</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">chdir</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">/funny_app</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">signal</span> <span class="no">INT</span> <span class="o">--</span> <span class="n">rails</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="mi">3001</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="ss">customer</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">subcontract</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">rvm</span> <span class="n">ruby</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="vi">@customer_app</span><span class="o">--</span><span class="n">chdir</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">/customer_app</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">signal</span> <span class="no">INT</span> <span class="o">--</span> <span class="n">rails</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">p</span> <span class="mi">3001</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let’s go through the crude_app Procfile entry piece by piece.</p>

<p><code>crude</code>                    &ndash; abbreviation for crude_app</p>

<p><code>subcontract</code>              &ndash; flags the following info to be passed into subcontract</p>

<p><code>--rvm</code>                    &ndash; RVM is the package manager</p>

<p><code>ruby-2.2.3@crude_app</code>     &ndash; our gemset for this project</p>

<p><code>--chdir</code>                  &ndash; flag signifying that you’re changing directories</p>

<p><code>./crude_app</code>              &ndash; the directory you’re changing to</p>

<p><code>--signal</code>                 &ndash; flag signifying that you’re designating termination signal</p>

<p><code>INT</code>                      &ndash; the actual termination signal type</p>

<p><code>-- rails s -p 300x</code>       &ndash; this is the command to start the process</p>

<p><strong>Foreman Start:</strong>
After you’ve written your Procfile, make sure you’re in the directory containing the Procfile, then type  “foreman start” in your terminal. Now you’re up and running.</p>

<p>As great as Foreman and Subcontractor are, there are a couple of downsides. These downsides are small, but can cause some hitches. I’ll go through them now, and share with you the workarounds I use.</p>

<p><strong> All of the rails development logs for each application are in the same window.</strong></p>

<p>I use the logs as the main source of information when I’m working, and it would be easy to get logs from  crude_app, silly_app, and encouraging_app mixed up. To get around this I’ll open another tab and tail the log manually so i know what’s coming from what.</p>

<p><strong> Pry breaks all of the things</strong></p>

<p>If I’m using pry to debug one of our applications that uses Foreman, I’ll run into trouble. When I reach the point where pry will stop execution of my application, I can’t interact with it in the terminal.</p>

<p>To deal with this, I navigate into the Procfile and comment out the line that starts the specific application I’m debugging, then I start that app manually in another tab.</p>

<p>These are pretty minor problems, and they are the only problems I’ve found working with foreman and subcontractor. Overall, these issues are tiny compared with the time I save &ndash; given the choice, I’ll go with Foreman and Subcontractor every time.</p>

    <id>http://nird-blog.herokuapp.com//blog/2016/02/09/the-first-gem-is-the-sweetest</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As my colleagues have mentioned in previous posts, we NIRDs have begun an initiative to contribute more to the open source community. As a junior developer who had never contributed to the open source community, this put me on unfamiliar ground. For many, that first step into the unknown is daunting &ndash; for me it was terrifying. I mean, I’m mostly self-taught, and as a result, I have a paralyzing fear of everyone discovering that I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">complete fraud</a>. ::Deep breath:: Until now, irrational self-preservation against an imaginary threat has won out over the desire to give back to the community that helped me get to where I am today; but that’s all changed (j/k I’m still scared, but I’m trying to be braver about <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/05/23/the-extraordinary-depressing-power-of-failing-upwards/">failing upwards</a>).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Thankfully, I wasn’t on my own &ndash; I was a part of a team! After dipping our toes into the open source pool by making a small contribution to someone else’s project, we decided that we wanted to learn something new &ndash; we wanted to build a gem. Since we were new to the process, we wanted to start with something small; conveniently, we had recently written a small amount of Javascript to integrate the handy <a href="https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate">will_paginate gem</a> into an AngularJS app, so this seemed like as good a point as any from which to proceed.</p>

<p>Since we had never built a gem, we began by researching the process. <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/books/build-a-ruby-gem/">Build a Ruby Gem by Brandon Hilkert</a> was thorough coverage of the subject &ndash; but actually way more than we needed! See, we wanted to build a gem that fed some Javascript and CSS into the asset pipeline of the apps that would use it &ndash; in the larger scheme of things, that’s not too heavy duty. Luckily, there are several <a href="https://gorails.com/episodes/creating-gems-for-frontend-javascript-libraries">quick</a> and <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/create-ruby-gem-jquery-plugin-basics/">dirty</a> <a href="http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/how-to-build-a-rails-engine/">guides</a> out there on to how to do this!</p>

<p>Since we had already built the feature into a project, it was really straightforward to pull it out into a gem. First, we abstracted the existing code as much as we could and took out any specific references to the app that it lived in. Generic code is reusable code, and what is a gem if not reusable code? Once we had done that, we just followed the guides linked to above on how to turn the code into a gem. Let me lift the main points from <a href="http://carlosbecker.com/posts/gemify-your-assets">Carlos Becker’s excellent post</a> to demonstrate how straightforward the process is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create the project skeleton
All this takes is one command in the terminal!</p></li>
<li><p>Create the vendor/assets folder
In the case of our gem, we actually created the app/assets folder. Why? Because, if you’re including someone else’s javascript in a project, for example, convention dictates that you put it in the vendor/assets folder. It’s not like anything is going to explode if you put javascript you wrote in vendor/assets, but the contents of vendor/assets are understood to be something akin to gems &ndash; code by other people that you include in your project. Since we wrote this code, it’s going in our assets folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the assets to the folders
All we did was move the files from the app we pulled our code from to PRETTY MUCH THE SAME EXACT PLACE (app/assets) in the gem we just made. Magical!</p></li>
<li><p>Test
Well&hellip;it can’t all be easy. This step is conquerable, but was definitely the hardest part of this project &ndash; so we’ll cover it in another post.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Once all that was done, we tried out our new gem in our original project by adding it to that project’s gemfile and then bundling. Viola! ng_will_paginate delivered up some nicely paginated angular objects via rails and the will_paginate gem!</p>

<p>There are two morals to this story:</p>

<p>The Ruby on Rails community is a wonderland of handy stuff created by people who are enthusiastic about making useful stuff. This isn’t limited to incredibly niche gems &ndash; it includes blog posts about how to make incredibly niche gems!
The bar is easier to surmount than our fears may be telling us &ndash; we too, can produce something that is helpful to the community.</p>

<p>I can’t count the number of times stumbling across a casual mention of some small bit of Rails wisdom has helped me in my path to becoming a better developer. If you’ve solved a problem, I can almost guarantee that someone out there will benefit from it if you make it available.</p>

    <link href="http://nird-blog.herokuapp.com//blog/2016/01/07/osnird-a-journey-into-open-source-gem-making/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-07T15:16:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://nird-blog.herokuapp.com//blog/2016/01/07/osnird-a-journey-into-open-source-gem-making</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Part 1: Introduction to GracePeriod &amp; README-Driven-Development</strong></h3>

<hr />

<p>  OSNird (for Open Source NIRD) is a new program here where NIRDs can spend work time contributing to open source projects. One team (Mike Pence, Adam Bell and myself) is writing a gem to address the imbalance that occurs when we place urgent concerns over important concerns and end up with technical debt. We are excited to take you with us on our learning journey in order to inspire more people to contribute to open source.</p>

<h3><strong>The Vision:</strong></h3>

<hr />

<p>  We all have those moments. Our feature must be shipped today so we cut corners. It’s hard to keep track of those pieces, especially when our manager now considers our feature done and has moved on to bigger and better features for us to implement. To extend and mix  the metaphor: all those cut corners are essentially swept under the rug. You won’t notice a couple under the rug, but eventually the rug becomes difficult to walk over without pain. Often by the time we are tripping over the technical debt, we have forgotten the story of that corner and how we were planning on fixing it. This is very inefficient. GracePeriod is designed to deal with these concerns. It will help developers hold their managers and themselves accountable to keep track of those corners and stay on top of technical debt. Through GracePeriod, we will be able to record contextual information about our  short cuts and our plans for correcting them so we will have a quick refresher available when the debt comes due.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3><strong>The Team:</strong></h3>

<hr />

<p>  The GracePeriod contingent of OSNird is pretty new to open source contribution. Before this project, Mike was the only team member who had developed any gems. Mike is our team’s senior developer and is providing a lot of guidance to the rest of the team. Adam and I are junior developers, excited to be getting our feet wet in open source. We all have very different skills, and we have really been enjoying working together to make a helpful tool.</p>

<p>  We are a decentralized team. NIRD has a flexible work from home policy and has team members from all around the country. So with Mike in Florida, and Adam and me in Washington, this is also great experience in remote collaboration.</p>

<h3><strong>The Initial Exploration:</strong></h3>

<hr />

<p>  Our first step was to look at other gems that tackle similar problems as GracePeriod or that provide well-implemented gem patterns. Rubocop, cucumber and rspec are all gems that you can run from the command line that give you information about your app. Factory_girl is an excellent implementation of a  flexible file structure. Additionally, contracts.ruby provides a good example for establishing rules that raise various warnings or errors when they are broken.</p>

<h3><strong>README-Driven-Development:</strong></h3>

<hr />

<p>  In order to get our team on the same page with the application, we first wrote a README of what we wanted to build. As with all agile projects, the actual scope and implementation details will change over time, but creating a unifying document was a great way to get our ideas down and discuss any obvious differences in understanding what this gem is for.</p>

<p>  It was during this process that we came up with the name for the gem. Our first thought was time bomb dsl. While a time bomb is a relatively accurate metaphor for what we are doing, it is an unnecessarily  violent image. After some exploration, we started looking at vocabulary around the concept of debt, since it is technical debt that we are discussing. In the language of debt, a grace period is a period of time where no payment is required but the debt is still present. Grace periods come to an end and then there are notifications that repayments must start. This is our goal for this gem &ndash; to notify developers and their managers that the grace extended to pieces of technical debt has come to an end and payment is coming due.</p>

<p>  One of the key parts of our README-driven-development process was defining the user experience. How would grace periods be defined? What would be involved in their implementation? This will continue to be a shifting process. Putting a definition to our initial ideas, however, was a great way to get juniors as well as seniors involved early in the creation process since developing ideas and interfaces does not require deep technical know-how. This ability to pull in folks that don’t have the technical experience with gems increased buy-in and allowed the team to coalesce around a central document that everyone had the opportunity to contribute to.</p>

<p>  We hope that you will follow us on our journey as we learn how to make a really cool gem and contribute to open source. We will keep sharing what we learn on this blog, and you can also tune in to our livestreamed mob programming sessions on Fridays from 8am-10am PST at <a href="https://www.livecoding.tv/wmuengineer/">https://www.livecoding.tv/wmuengineer/</a> . There&rsquo;s even a live chat if you want to interact with us.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the next post in this series, which will be about setup, configuration, and starting the gem.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The NIRDS have been busy this year sharing our love of Ruby, Rails and programming. One of the ways we do this is by sponsoring and speaking at conferences through-out the world. If you haven’t been to a Ruby conference &ndash; I highly recommend attending one. Different conferences have their own personalities &ndash; so try out a couple ’til you find one you like.</p>

<p>Conferences are a great way to meet other Rubyists from around the world &ndash; to exchange ideas and learn about what cool projects people are working on. Of course you can do a lot of this online, but it&rsquo;s great to meet face-to-face sometimes. When we aren’t attending conferences &ndash; you might find a NIRD at <a href="http://www.seattlerb.org/">Seattle.rb</a> or one of the other coding meet ups around Seattle.</p>

<p>Here’s a round-up of some of the places we’ve been so far this year:</p>

<h2><a href="https://ruby.onales.com/">Ruby on Ales</a></h2>

<p>This conference is every spring in Bend, Oregon. Bend is known for the great outdoors and beer and isn&rsquo;t too far a trip from Seattle. NIRD was one of the sponsors this year (we gave out the super cool NIRD pint glasses!) And Kerri gave a talk on &ldquo;Harry Potter and the Legacy Code Base&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here’s a the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sw9mhKtgCk">video</a>
and the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kerrizor/harry-potter-and-the-legacy-code-base-ruby-on-ales">slides</a> from the conference.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2><a href="http://abrilproruby.com/">Abril Pro Ruby</a></h2>

<p>Renée was happy to leave rainy Seattle for warm, sunny Brazil to be a keynote speaker at this conference. She spoke about &ldquo;Classic Algorithms in Ruby&rdquo;. You should check out this talk if you&rsquo;ve thought Big-O notation was only something that comes up in tech interviews.</p>

<p>Here’s the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVulPTs8wSA">video</a>
 and the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/reneedv/classic-algorithms-in-ruby">slides</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://programme2014.scottishrubyconference.com/">Scottish Ruby Conference</a></h2>

<p>In May, Kerri traveled to Scotland to give a talk on &ldquo;Concurrency for !Dummies (Who Don&rsquo;t Get It (&hellip;Yet))&rdquo;. (In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed &ndash; the NIRDs like to travel).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NIRD is super excited to announce the public launch of our Ruby on Rails Bootcamp classes in Seattle, WA! We’ve been teaching corporate clients around the world for years, but this is our first chance to share the awesomeness that is Ruby on Rails with our Seattle community.</p>

<p>We’re launching our first class at the end of February with a 5 Day Ruby on Rails Bootcamp designed for students with some programming experience who are interested in learning Ruby on Rails or leveling up their web development skills. Registration is already open, and you can find out more at <a href="http://nird.us/bootcamps">nird.us/bootcamps</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Most bootcamps require a serious time commitment (like, quit your job, move your family across the country, and say goodbye to your social life for the next 6 months). Here at NIRD, we think that’s kind of crazy. Ruby on Rails is one of the easiest languages to learn, and we firmly believe that everyone can do it. NIRD bootcamps are designed to be short&mdash;the longest is four weeks, and most are one week or less. Students can attend via web conference, and homework is submitted electronically. At the end of the course, you’ll be able to build and maintain your own Ruby on Rails web apps.</p>

<p>We offer intro courses to Ruby on Rails for students who are considering switching careers, as well as professional development classes for experienced developers who are interested in learning Ruby on Rails or want to accelerate their careers by enhancing their current skill levels.</p>

<p>All of the classes will be taught at the NIRD office in Seattle by experienced instructors who have taught at the University of Washington, CodeFellows, and Ada Developers Academy. Our instructors are some of the best in the business, with a passion for communicating the beauty and versatility of Ruby on Rails. They draw examples directly from their work as professional developers, ensuring that the knowledge students gain is relevant today.</p>

    <link href="http://nird-blog.herokuapp.com//blog/2013/10/24/the-advantages-of-a-custom-css-framework/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-24T16:27:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://nird-blog.herokuapp.com//blog/2013/10/24/the-advantages-of-a-custom-css-framework</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your organization is building a premier app. You are confident in your target audience and the excellence of your design, and yet you know that in a rapidly evolving technology environment change is inevitable. NIRD has extensive experience working with a variety of design styles and front-end frameworks. Regardless of the style or framework you choose, the best practice for developing maintainable front-end code is to modularize your front-end elements. Breaking your front-end code into discrete chunks makes it easier to adapt to new technologies, change designs, and add new functionality over the life of the application.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Each project starts with web designers translating business needs and customer knowledge into visually appealing style guides for a website. These guides are then “sliced-up” into style and behavior code by front-end developers to efficiently present the back-end business logic to users via a custom user interface.</p>

<p>Front end frameworks are sometimes used to automate portions of this process. One well-known framework is Twitter Bootstrap, which provides complete css stylesheets and prepackaged javascript behaviors to dramatically reduce or eliminate the design process for prototyping applications. For hackathon projects and minimum viable products, Bootstrap can deliver a professional (if stylistically generic) presentation to end users.</p>

<p>What happens when the style for your new site, based on carefully considered branding decisions, doesn&rsquo;t look or behave like Bootstrap? When a web designer presents a style guide for a site, and did not start with Bootstrap elements, some key disadvantages become apparent:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bootstrap is highly interconnected css code. Changes can have far-reaching and unanticipated side effects; change becomes expensive.</li>
<li>If the design was not specifically created with Bootstrap in mind, those beautiful style features your organization has invested in will need to be shoehorned inefficiently and awkwardly into existing framework components.</li>
<li>As the design changes or is expanded in the future, Bootstrap will be increasingly resistant to modifications. (This is true of designs that began with Bootstrap in mind as well.)</li>
</ul>


<p>There are a variety of other front-end frameworks that bring fewer visual design opinions with them, opting instead to provide functionality and behavior tools. These frameworks are more flexible, but your custom design may still lead to conflict with your framework when your design needs violate its underlying assumptions. For example, consider how you want your device to display in a mobile context: should it look the same for a small blackberry screen and a large android screen? A given framework may support this, or it may assume that all phone contexts are roughly the same as an iPhone.</p>

<p>Designers can approach this problem by limiting their stylistic and behavior choices to conform with a front-end framework, or a front-end framework can be selected afterward to minimize conflicts with the design intent (absorbing the additional maintenance costs when changes become necessary). Key considerations for choosing a preexisting front-end are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which design components will be useful for this design?</li>
<li>How many extra features are included that will have to be rendered inert?</li>
<li>Does the framework bring enough value to overcome the costs of its use?</li>
</ul>


<p>NIRD has found that the best practice is usually to avoid the compromise altogether. We create consistently and efficiently coded styles and behavior for each project, with a focus on remaining true to the design. Our approach is inspired by <a href="http://roytomeij.com/">Roy Tomeij</a>, using SASS partials to create modular visual components to maximize reuse. When a new component is needed, it becomes simple to extend an existing module or add a new one. Style and behavior become separate concerns, making changes inexpensive and easily understood.</p>

<p>You are investing in the success of your app today with an awesome and intuitive design. Take advantage of NIRD&rsquo;s front end expertise to invest in your app&rsquo;s future.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi &ndash; I&rsquo;m Bethany Rentz and I just started working at NIRD on Monday. I&rsquo;m very excited to join the team &ndash; and to start working on client projects! Coming from a large software company &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure what to expect working at a small office &ndash; but so far everyone is a lot of fun and very enthusiastic. BTW &ndash; we are having an office warming party next week &ndash; which I&rsquo;m sure is also a welcome party for me &ndash; so everyone can check out the new digs: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NIRD-Seattle/events/136283852/">HQ Warming</a>.</p>

<p>There is a lot of cool stuff going on here &ndash; I got an overview of current projects and what I could work on. There are a couple of projects I will be working on &ndash; and will start getting up to speed on all the NIRD tools.</p>

<p>In the afternoon &ndash; we went out for Frozen Custard &ndash; a NIRD tradition &ndash; and I learned about the company values &ndash; most importantly our focus on the customer and our strong collaboration culture! Then it was time for me to update the NIRD website with my <a href="http://nird.us/bethany">bio</a> &ndash; I made the changes and deployed the code to production.</p>

<p>Over the next couple of weeks I&rsquo;ll be focused on getting up to speed on existing projects and starting to do some development. Hopefully in a future blog post I&rsquo;ll share something more technical.</p>

    <link href="http://nird-blog.herokuapp.com//blog/2013/09/05/customizing-sublime-text/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-05T15:47:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://nird-blog.herokuapp.com//blog/2013/09/05/customizing-sublime-text</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>What Sublime Text is:</h3>

<hr />

<p>Sublime Text is a cross platform text editor, excellent for code, markup, and prose. It&rsquo;s free to try and fun to customize. You can customize it in several ways: the color scheme, the UI aspects, key bindings, and a variety of preferences.
 <!-- more --></p>

<h3>How to get it:</h3>

<hr />

<ul>
<li>Download from <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">http://www.sublimetext.com/</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/getting_started/install.html">Installation instructions vary</a> according to your OS.</li>
<li>You can try out the full version for as long as you&rsquo;d like before you buy, but it&rsquo;s &ldquo;nagware&rdquo;&ndash; will remind you often to purchase a license.</li>
<li>Unlimited commercial licenses cost $70 currently. Purchase one <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/buy">here</a>.</li>
<li>When you enter a purchased license key (under Help &ndash;> Enter Key), no more nagging!</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cool customization:</h3>

<hr />

<p>Get <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/">Package Control</a> to manage plugins. It makes adding new themes, color schemes, and more super easy.</p>

<ol>
<li> Install Package Control via the <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/installation">instructions</a>.</li>
<li> In Sublime, press Cmd+Shift+P and type &ldquo;install package&rdquo;. Hit enter or click on the suggested choice, &ldquo;Package Control: Install Package&rdquo;.</li>
<li> Oh wow, that&rsquo;s all the packages available, sorted and searchable by name. That&rsquo;s not actually super helpful if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re looking for. I&rsquo;d start by <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/browse">browsing</a> some popular packages, or <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/search">searching</a> for something specific, on the Package Control website. There you can see full descriptions, links to Github repos, and more.</li>
<li> Once you find what you want, do Cmd+Shift+P and &ldquo;install package&rdquo; again, then search for the one you want.</li>
<li> When you select a package, it&rsquo;ll download and install for you- easy!</li>
</ol>


<h4>Appearance</h4>

<p>Color schemes effect the text area: font colors and syntax highlighting. Sublime comes loaded with a few schemes, you can make your own, you can download and install them manually, or you can use Package Control to find and install them.</p>

<ol>
<li> View available schemes and change your active one: SublimeText2 &ndash;> Preferences &ndash;> Color Schemes</li>
<li> Creating your own scheme is complicated and outside the scope of this post.</li>
<li> Download and install a scheme manually:

<ul>
<li>Find a cool scheme <a href="http://colorsublime.com/">here</a> or elsewhere.</li>
<li>Download one you like. You should get a .tmTheme file.</li>
<li>Open SublimeText2 &ndash;> Preferences &ndash;> Browse Packages&hellip;</li>
<li>Paste your downloaded .tmTheme file into the &ldquo;Color Scheme &ndash; Default&rdquo; folder.</li>
<li>The new scheme will now appear in SublimeText2 &ndash;> Preferences &ndash;> Color Schemes &ndash;> Color Scheme- Default menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Use Package Control to install a scheme:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/search/color%20scheme">Search for color schemes</a> on the Package Control site.</li>
<li>View the available ones, checkout screenshots, and pick some favorites.</li>
<li>Follow the Package Control instructions above to find and install the ones you like into your Sublime Text.</li>
<li>See available schemes and change the active one in the SublimeText2 &ndash;> Preferences &ndash;> Color Schemes menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Themes generally effect the user interface of Sublime, in addition to the appearance, though it&rsquo;s not a hard and fast definition. They may change menu configurations, what information is desplayed around the text area, or add features. The <a href="https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/">Soda Theme</a> (both light and dark versions) are very popular choices. You can install themes in much the same ways as color schemes.</p>

<ol>
<li> View your active theme:

<ul>
<li>Open SublimeText2 &ndash;> Preferences &ndash;> Default</li>
<li>Find the line that says &ldquo;theme&rdquo;: &ldquo;SuperBasicTheme.sublime-theme&rdquo;</li>
<li>Whatever SuperBasicTheme actually says is the theme that is in effect currently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Creating your own theme is complicated and outside the scope of this post.</li>
<li> Download and install a theme manually:

<ul>
<li>Find a cool theme on <a href="https://github.com/search?q=sublime+theme&amp;nwo=buymeasoda%2Fsoda-theme&amp;search_target=global&amp;ref=cmdform">Github</a> or elsewhere.</li>
<li>Download one you like. You should get a directory (unzip if it comes as a zipped file).</li>
<li>Open SublimeText2 &ndash;> Preferences &ndash;> Browse Packages&hellip;</li>
<li>Paste your downloaded directory into the &ldquo;Packages&rdquo; folder.</li>
<li>To activate new theme, you&rsquo;ll need to add/edit a line in your SublimeText2 &ndash;> Preferences &ndash;> User file. It will be &ldquo;theme&rdquo;: &ldquo;CoolNewTheme.sublime-theme&rdquo; where CoolNewTheme is replaced with the actual name of your cool new theme. There should be activation instructions from wherever you download from that will give you the correct name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Use Package Control to install a scheme:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/search/theme">Search for themes</a> on the Package Control site.</li>
<li>View the available ones, check out screenshots, and pick a keeper.</li>
<li>Follow the Package Control instructions at the beginning of this section to find and install the ones you like into your Sublime Text.</li>
<li>To activate new theme, you&rsquo;ll need to add/edit a line in your SublimeText2 &ndash;> Preferences &ndash;> User file. It will be &ldquo;theme&rdquo;: &ldquo;CoolNewTheme.sublime-theme&rdquo; where CoolNewTheme is replaced with the actual name of your cool new theme. There should be activation instructions from wherever you download from that will give you the correct name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h4>Settings</h4>

<p>There are two Settings files: Default (global) and User. Settings in the User file will override the Defaults if they conflict. Normally, people edit the User one and leave the Default as is, as a reference for things that can be changed. Your color scheme and theme will be listed in the Settings files, but there are other ways to change them than through these files (see below).</p>

<p>Open SublimeText2 &ndash;> Preferences &ndash;> [Defaut or User]</p>

<p>Some popular preferences to add or change are:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;save_on_focus_lost&rdquo;: true

<ul>
<li>Automatically saves the file you&rsquo;re editing when you leave it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;wordWrap&rdquo;: true

<ul>
<li>Word wrap set to always be on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;highlight_line&rdquo;: true

<ul>
<li>Highlights the line your cursor is in</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;line_padding_bottom&rdquo;: 1

<ul>
<li>Gives each line a bit of padding underneath it, making for easier to read text</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Key Bindings</h4>

<p>There are also two Key Binding files: Defaut (global) and User. Again, the User file will override the Default, so it&rsquo;s recommended that you leave the Default as a reference and only edit the User. As you add new values to the User file, you&rsquo;ll see the keyboard hints in the dropdown menu reflect your changes. Cool!</p>

    <link href="http://nird-blog.herokuapp.com//blog/2013/08/29/about-oauth/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-29T21:35:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://nird-blog.herokuapp.com//blog/2013/08/29/about-oauth</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OAuth is an open standard for authentication. It can be used in two different ways.</p>

<h4>Mode 1 &ndash; Third party authentication</h4>

<p>This is the mode primarily talked about on the internet. The idea is that you authorize one site to get limited data from another site using the OAuth API. For example, a site lets you login with your Facebook or Google credentials instead of setting up an account with them, or a Twitter phone app can get and send tweets from your account.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="center" src="http://nird-blog.herokuapp.com//images/signin.png" width="250" height="150" title="Example sign in" ></p>

<p>The API Producer (Facebook, etc.) is responsible for validating the user&rsquo;s credentials internally and then giving the Consumer site a special token that the Producer will treat as an authenticated user with limited access. Each Producer specifies what is available via their OAuth API, so it can be as little as email address, or as much as everything about a user on the site. The Producer can also make the authorization tokens expire after a set period of time for additional security.
The benefit of using OAuth for authentication depends on what the Consumer site needs. At the most basic level, the Consumer site can use another site&rsquo;s user system instead of maintaining a separate one. This is convenient for the user, who does not have to have additional usernames/passwords, and puts the onus of storing the passwords securely on the other site. If the Consumer site wants to interact with the Producer, then the API gives a clear set of available interactions and enforces that the user permitted the Consumer site to perform such actions. So OAuth lets two sites share private data once the user has granted permission for this sharing.</p>

<h4>Mode 2 &ndash; Browser pass through</h4>

<p>This mode requires that you have control of both the Producer and Consumer sites/servers. It is for when you have two servers that need to talk to each other, but they are not within the same firewall, so they cannot communicate directly. You can use OAuth signatures and the browser to proxy pass the communication.
For example, say that a site has several ebooks that in turn have photos within them. These photos are stored on a separate server than the ebooks and they are authentication controlled. When a browser (aka user) asks for an ebook, the ebook Consumer wants to be able to send the browser working links to the photos so everything looks good in the browser. Since the Consumer knows an authentication token for the Producer, it signs (part of the OAuth protocol) the url and the Producer will then load the links when the browser goes to load the ebook.
This is valuable because it keeps the Producer&rsquo;s data private except when the authorized site asks for it. It is a preset version of mode 1 enabling the servers to act on the behalf of a possibly anonymous user. In addition, if expiration times are added to the Producer&rsquo;s OAuth filtering, then even the permitted user will have limited access to the data.</p>

<h4>Mode 3(ish) &ndash; Hybrid</h4>

<p>Some sites let you set a single &ldquo;admin&rdquo; OAuth token that can then be used to perform the API calls with specific user information contained within the POST command as needed.</p>

<p>Of note, OAuth has two different versions, 1.0 and 2.0. They are not compatible and have very different intentions. This is relevant, because many people argue that the new version is less secure than 1.0 and should not be used. For an explanation from a creator of OAuth 1.0 on the issues with 2.0 see: <a href="http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/">http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/</a></p>
