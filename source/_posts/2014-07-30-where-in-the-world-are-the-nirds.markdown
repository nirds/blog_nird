The NIRDS have been busy this year sharing our love of Ruby, Rails and programming. One of the ways we do this is by sponsoring and speaking at conferences through-out the world. If you haven’t been to a Ruby conference - I highly recommend attending one. Different conferences have their own personalities - so try out a couple ’til you find one you like.

Conferences are a great way to meet other Rubyists from around the world - to exchange ideas and learn about what cool projects people are working on. Of course you can do a lot of this online, but it's great to meet face-to-face sometimes. When we aren’t attending conferences - you might find a NIRD at [Seattle.rb](http://www.seattlerb.org/) or one of the other coding meet ups around Seattle. 

Here’s a round-up of some of the places we’ve been so far this year:

## [Ruby on Ales](https://ruby.onales.com/)
This conference is every spring in Bend, Oregon. Bend is known for the great outdoors and beer and isn't too far a trip from Seattle. NIRD was one of the sponsors this year (we gave out the super cool NIRD pint glasses!) And Kerri gave a talk on "Harry Potter and the Legacy Code Base".

Here’s a the talk [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sw9mhKtgCk)
and the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/kerrizor/harry-potter-and-the-legacy-code-base-ruby-on-ales) from the conference.

## [Abril Pro Ruby](http://abrilproruby.com/)
Renée was happy to leave rainy Seattle for warm, sunny Brazil to be a keynote speaker at this conference. She spoke about "Classic Algorithms in Ruby". You should check out this talk if you've thought Big-O notation was only something that comes up in tech interviews.

Here’s the talk [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVulPTs8wSA)
 and the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/reneedv/classic-algorithms-in-ruby).

## [Scottish Ruby Conference](http://programme2014.scottishrubyconference.com/)
In May, Kerri traveled to Scotland to give a talk on "Concurrency for !Dummies (Who Don't Get It (...Yet))". (In case you haven't noticed - the NIRDs like to travel).

Here's the talk [video](http://vimeo.com/97522205)
 and the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/kerrizor/concurrency-for-dummies-who-dont-get-it-dot-dot-dot-yet).

## What's next?
There are more conferences coming up this year on NIRD's calendar.  As I'm writing this post Kerri is on her way to [Burlington Ruby](http://burlingtonrubyconference.com/). And [Cascadia Ruby](http://cascadiaruby.com/) is just around the corner - down in Portland.

And feel free to contact us if you'd like us to come speak at your event.
